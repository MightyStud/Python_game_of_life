# Python game of life
An implementation of game of life in python, [The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

This python approach tries to use basic python without much any external libraries except Numpy.

+ [numpyToJson](https://github.com/MightyStud/Python_game_of_life/blob/main/numpyToJson.py) script convert a numpy array of ones (1) and zeros (0) to JSON file 
+ [The_game_of_life](https://github.com/MightyStud/Python_game_of_life/blob/main/The_game_of_life.py) script takes json file and convert it back to a numpy array and cycle through the game of life algorithm
